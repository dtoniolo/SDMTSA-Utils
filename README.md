# Contents
This small repo contains:
- a few utilities for producing graphs with Plotly.
- models and code for the final project of the  Streaming Data Managment and Time Series Analysis course.

# How To Use
`plotly_utils` can be installed with pip, just run
```
pip install .
```
while being in the root directory of this repository.

The other part of the codebase works only by adding this folder to your `PYTHONPATH`:
```
export export PYTHONPATH="path/to/SDMTSA Utils"
```
